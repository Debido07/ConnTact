# ConnTact

Software framework to enable agile robotic assembly applications.

(Connect + Tactile)

## Overview

![Framework diagram](resource/framework.png)

The ConnTact package provide a efficient framework for assembly algorithm development for compliant robots. It allows the user to define fully tactile methods for making tight-tolerance connections in a human-like way.

ConnTact includes an implementation of the [transitions](https://github.com/pytransitions/transitions) state machine package to define the steps and decisions critical to your algorithm. It also provides a suite of tools and examples to sense the environment based on force feedback - detecting collision, hard surfaces, and position changes. Finally we define some basic motion profiles which can be used to probe the environment and align the tool to the workpiece.

## Installation

Development of framework was done under Ubuntu Focal (20.04) using ROS Noetic.

  - Clone the repository into the `src/` directory of a ROS workspace (e.g., `~/ros_ws/src`)
  - Install Python dependencies `pip install transitions modern_robotics`
  - Install ROS source dependencies:
    - `cd ~/ros_ws/src`
    - `vcs import < conntact/dependencies.rosinstall`
  - Install ROS package dependencies: `rosdep install --rosdistro noetic --ignore-src --from-paths .`
  - Source ROS and build the workspace: `. /opt/ros/noetic/setup.bash`, `catkin build`


## Usage

### Structure

Conntact is structured with 3 levels of functionality:

#### AssemblyTools

> *Do the following job* ***here*** *and at* ***this*** *angle*

  The AssemblyTools package provides a bunch of utility functions. These translate data from hardware into **task space**: the frame-of-reference of the task to be accomplished. This way, an algorithm developed at a given position and orientation is automatically reoriented and repositioned when a new task position is fed into the system. AssemblyTools also provides useful data, such as speed estimation and sensor data filtering.

#### AlgorithmBlocks

> *First do* ***this*** *and then do* ***this*** *and then* ***this***

  The AlgorithmBlocks program is an implimentation of the pytransitions Machine package. It comprises example functions which run according to an easily-reconfigurable state machine. By breaking a task down into sequential tasks, you can use AlgorithmBlocks to sequence these tasks and add decision-making/redundancy/fallback functionality.

#### AssemblyStep

> *Move like* ***this*** *until you feel* ***this*** *happen*

  AlgorithmBlocks can run *functions* for simple tasks, but for tactile sensing you often need a lot of specific variable and flags to track conditions. These tasks are streamlined with the AssemblyStep class. Each Step object provides all the basic functions for a sensing task - setup, loop behavior, completion checking - and can be easily expanded or overriden to accomplish a wide variety of tasks.

### Development

We suggest the following workflow to take a task from a human and give it to a robot. We'll use the example of driving a machine screw into a threaded hole to illustrate each step.

#### 1. Choose the frame-of-reference for your task.
  * The threaded hole is vertical. We'll establish the Z axis to be vertical, concentric with the hole. The screw's Z axis goes along its axis pointing from the head to the threads.

#### 2. Break the human task down into a sequence of tactile *steps* and *decisions*.
  * Roughly align the Z axes of the screw and hole.
  * Move the screw downward until it hits the surface where the hole is bored.
  * Try moving the screw around. If it catches, it's already partway into the hole. If it moves freely, it's hit the surface instead.
    * If sliding on the surface, move the screw outward in a spiral until it catches in the hole and develops a strong horizontal reaction force.
    * Let it settle downward as far as possible.
  * Turn the screw counter-clockwise applying light downward pressure and complying in the Z direction. Continue until it settles one thread-pitch distance in the Z direction, around .8mm for an M6 screw. This will register on the force sensor as a "click": a very brief drop to zero reaction force, and then a sudden rise back to the applied force. If either of these occurs, we are pretty certain the thread is ready to engage.
  * Try turning clockwise, applying light downward pressure and complying in the Z direction.
    * If the torque required to turn rises sharply, or the screw stops turning before it has moved the expected distance, we may have  the screw cross-threaded. Unscrew it and restart from the previous step.
    * If the torque only rises until we move downward the length of the screw:
      * Apply the specified torque to finalize the connection.
      * Release and retract and we're done.

#### 3. Analyze each *step* and determine the *continuous* and *end conditions.*

For each step above, identify the *force directions* and *free movement directions* required. 

Force: The end effector will comply with outside forces, but will add the specified force to create continuous motion until impeded.

Free movement directions: The end effector can be disturbed from its desired position by outside forces. For each dimension (X,Y, and Z), you can specify whether it tries to *return to its assigned position* or *update its assigned posiiton to the new position*. This allows the robot to continuously move in a predictable way.

* To move the screw downward in free space until it hits a hard surface:
  * Apply a small downward force to move the robot downward.
  * Comply in the vertical (z) direction - move as the force assigned above dictates.
  * Do not comply in horizontal directions (x and y); assign the expected hole location to these dimensions.
  * Do not comply in orientation.

## Running Examples

The repository is currently set up with examples that demonstrate assembly tasks for the [NIST assembly task board](https://www.nist.gov/el/intelligent-systems-division-73500/robotic-grasping-and-manipulation-assembly/assembly) using a Universal Robots UR10e. The system can insert any of the circular pegs into their respective holes. Relative locations of these holes on the board are already recorded in *config/peg_in_hole_params.yaml*.

To run the examples, you must first determine the location and position of the NIST task board (or equivalent). First, by jogging the UR manually, locate the corner of the task board in the robot's base frame. We selected an arbitrary corner to be the board's origin, as shown below.
 
![board_overall](resource/board_overall.jpg)

Align the gripper's axes as marked on the board (align the +X axis with that drawn on the board.)

![board_frame](resource/board_corner.jpg)

Based on the robot's tcp position as displayed on the "Move" tab of the pendant, update the expected position and Z-axis orientation of the board in `peg_in_hole_params.yaml` under `environment state`:
```
environment_state:
    task_frame:
        position: **[-639, 282, -337]**
        orientation: **[0, 0, 0]**
    kitting_frame:
        position: [640, 544, -502]
        orientation: [0, 0, 0]
```
Now the robot can find the rough locations of each of the circular holes. No need to be perfect; the whole system is designed to overcome small inaccuracies! Next, you can select the peg to be inserted by modifying the `task`:
```
task:
    target_peg: "peg_10mm"
    target_hole: "hole_10mm"
    starting_tcp: "tip"
    assumed_starting_height: 0.0
    restart_height: -0.1
```
Currently two algorithms are implemented that perform peg insertion tasks: a vertical searching method and a corner-contact searching method.

To run these examples, open a terminals sourced to the built project workspace and run:

    roslaunch conntact ur10e_upload_compliance.launch algorithm_selected:=<algorithm>

Where `<algorithm>` is either `spiral_search_node` or `corner_search_node`*.

> âš  **Note:** Corner Search mode is WIP. This program, or any other which changes the robot TCP orientation, currently causes a rapid motion to assume the specified orientation which can cause collision or damage or just scare you out of your pants. We recommend leaving the orientation vertical until this problem is solved.
